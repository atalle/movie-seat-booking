# Movie Seat Booking
Vanilla JS web project with movie and seat selection to purchase tickets! Completed as part of Brad Traversy's [20+ Projects with Vanilla JS](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/?referralCode=F9B7C7FED834F91ADE75) course.

### Project specs 
- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- User can select a movie/price
- User can select/deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh


I also updated the UI slightly to improve usability ðŸ‘‡
